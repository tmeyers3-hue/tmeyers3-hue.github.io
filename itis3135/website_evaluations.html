            <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.anuchome.com">Good Crap Site</a></h3>
            <p>This site serves as a landing page for an interior design studio</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Contrast</h4>
                    <p>This site uses contrast to guide the viewer through the webpage. For example on the first view of the page, the two main elements by size are their logo and an example of their work. The remaining crucial elements are much smaller and unobtrusive.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Repetition</h4>
                    <p>The site uses a consistent grid approach for structuring its content</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Alignment</h4>
                    <p>The aformentioned grid aligns the site into four quartiles vertically. This allows the content to be sectioned off in various ways while keeping contents aligned.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Proximity</h4>
                    <p>The grid allows the content to be spaced evenly and not get cluttered.</p>
                </li>
                
            </ul>

        <section class="site-2">
            <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.discountbedsbelfast.co.uk/">Bad Crap Site</a></h3>
            <p>This site is the storefront for a discount bed seller in the UK</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Contrast</h4>
                    <p>Most of the body of the website is the same default white, not providing much color contrast. Bold and Italics are used inconsistently.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Repetition</h4>
                    <p>Details under some listings for beds are left out in others. The page never establishes sections that could be repeated, and opts for a long string of differing information.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Alignment</h4>
                    <p>The page is mostly one running column which doesn't make for many alignment issues, but certain elements appear in different places as you scroll.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Proximity</h4>
                    <p>Plenty of examples of large blocks of white space or random empty lines</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
