            </p>
            <p>CSSTest began as a side-project created by a small group of frontend developers who all shared the same
                frustration: learning CSS Grid was powerful, but the learning resources were scattered, inconsistent, or
                overly complex. We found ourselves jumping between blog posts, documentation pages, and code sandboxes
                just
                to piece together how Grid really worked in real projects.</p>
            <p>
                What started as a simple personal cheatsheet gradually grew into a more ambitious idea — a fully
                interactive, beginner-friendly learning space focused solely on CSS Grid. We wanted something that
                didn’t
                just tell you the properties, but showed you how they worked, let you experiment with them, and tested
                your
                understanding through hands-on challenges.</p>

            <p>
                So we built CSSTest: a clean, accessible resource designed to make mastering CSS Grid easier, faster,
                and
                more enjoyable than ever. Today, it continues to evolve with new features, tools, and quizzes — all
                shaped
                by the same goal that started it: giving learners a clear, practical, and engaging way to understand one
                of
                CSS’s most powerful layout systems.</p>
